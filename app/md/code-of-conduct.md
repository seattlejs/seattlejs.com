excerpt: SeattleJS is a safe and inclusive event for everyone
---
SeattleJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof). SeattleJS does not tolerate harassment of conference participants or staff at any time nor in any form.

Anyone violating these guidelines may be removed from the event and/or our platforms at our sole sole discretion.

Thank you for helping make SeattleJS a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## Expected Behavior

All communication at our events (in-person or virtual) or on our platforms (Discord, Meetup, etc) should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Please be kind to others. 

Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.

- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing comments.
- Be mindful of your fellow attendees and alert an Organizer if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or someone violating this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech and comments, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of SeattleJS.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, religion (or lack thereof), disability, inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides), deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

SeattleJS will not tolerate any unacceptable behavior from any attendee or other participant, including sponsors, speakers, and those with decision-making authority.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If an attendee or other participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from SeattleJS without warning (and without refund if applicable).

## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an Organizer immediately. 

If you are experiencing a life threatening emergency, dial 9-1-1.

## Scope

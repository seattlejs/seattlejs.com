## Speaker Page and Discount

Every speaker has their own dedicated speaker page, like [this one](/talks/react-rendering-with-nextjs). It's wired-up with nice `og:image` tags, so it's great for sharing on your favorite social media channels (Twitter, Bluesky, LinkedIn, Discord, etc).

We have also set all speakers up with a personal $100 discount on tickets, which you are welcome to share however you like. Mailing lists are preferred, but feel free to share this code on social media as well. This is a not-for-profit event, and we just want people to join us. If you don't remember your code, just ask an organizer.

## Travel & Lodging

We recommend that you arrive on Monday, August 7 and depart on Wednesday, August 9. Obviously, feel free to come earlier or stay later :)

As soon as you book your flights, please let us know when you arrive and depart, dates and times. We are recommending that speakers stay at the Stay Pineapple, which is a fun hotel and is located walking distance to the conference venue.

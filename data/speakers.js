      simply including a JQuery CDN link in your HTML. As developers for the web, we often focus
      exclusively on the network as a point of latency, however, new performance issues are being
      unearthed by the use of an ever larger and more diverse set of web-enabled devices. Build
      steps to compile, transpile, tree-shake(?!), inline, and more are becoming increasingly
      common - primarily due to the rapidly expanding scale at which people use modules and packages
      in their JavaScript. In this talk, I'll discuss my experience learning the Rust programming
      language and writing an operating system, IntermezzOS, and what it taught me about these
      useful, yet intimidating, frontend JavaScript workflows. We'll take a close look at the
      "abstraction tax" that we all pay in spades, and discuss the methods by which tools can help
      mitigate this pernicious issue. By the end of the talk, you'll be ready to engage with your

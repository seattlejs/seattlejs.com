    bio: `Marcy Sutton works on web accessibility tools at Deque Systems, a company focused on
      digital equality. In 2016, O'Reilly gave Marcy a Web Platform Award for her work in
      accessibility. She loves co-leading the Accessibility Seattle meetup and is starting a code
      and coffee club for Girl Develop It in Bellingham.`,
    synopsis: `We have an opportunity to improve the Web for people with disabilities with every
      test or commit, anywhere in the world. In the United States, accessibility guidelines have
      been established–and utilized by other countries–but compliance laws are still evolving.
      There is also increasing uncertainty surrounding civil and disability rights. Now more than
      ever, we must do more to promote access and safety, security, and privacy. It's our duty to
      design and develop digital experiences that also honor our users' rights to inclusion–no
      matter where they live, or how they access the Web. You can use your JavaScript skills for
      the good of the people, and I'll show you how.`
